<h1 id="newinstancecreator">New Instance Creator</h1>

<p>The New Instance Creator (you can call him Nicolas!) is a tool used alongside the <a href="https://theos.dev/docs/">Theos</a> build system to generate the boilerplate for a project or subproject. It can ask questions to help you fill in certain details such as the project name. NIC templates are tar archives with a certain structure that NIC can understand. NIC was once integrated in the same Git repo as Theos, but now has been decoupled from Theos to its own repo.</p>

<p>Documentation is available on the <a href="https://theos.dev/docs/nic">NIC page</a> of <a href="https://theos.dev/docs/">theos.dev</a>.</p>

<p>Licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0, with an exception that projects created using NIC are not required to use the same license. Refer to <a href="LICENSE.md">LICENSE.md</a>.</p>
